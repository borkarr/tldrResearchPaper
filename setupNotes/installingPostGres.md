# Installing on Linux
Specifically Arch Linux because it's what I'm using, most of this should be
similar for Mac OSX. If you're on windows then you're on your own and why do you
hate yourself?

# Install for your OS
On my system this is simply

```
sudo pacman -S postgresql
```

On Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get install postgresql
sudo apt-get install postgresql-contrib
```

On Mac this is

```
brew install postgresql
```

If you don't have brew installed then what are you even doing? Just run this and
then run the above command for mac.

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

# Post Installation

After you install we need to switch the postgres user called ```postgres```. On 
mac or linux you can run this only if you are a sudoer (you can run admin stuff)

```
sudo -u postgres -i
```

If not then run this

```
su
su -l postgres
```

After that is done your prompt should look like:
Where Voltron is your computer's name or hostname if you're on linux

```
[postgres@Voltron ~]$ 
```

Now we must initialize the database cluster by running the following

```
[postgres@Voltron ~]$ initdb --locale $LANG -E UTF8 -D '/var/lib/postgres/data'
```

You may want to make sure your LANG environment variable is set with

```
echo $LANG
```

Here is what mine returned: `en_US.UTF-8`

if it was successful it should look like this:

    The files belonging to this database system will be owned by user "postgres".
    This user must also own the server process.
 
    The database cluster will be initialized with locale "en_US.UTF-8".
    The default text search configuration will be set to "english".
    
    Data page checksums are disabled.

    WARNING: enabling "trust" authentication for local connections
    You can change this by editing pg_hba.conf or using the option -A, or
    --auth-local and --auth-host, the next time you run initdb.
    
    Success. You can now start the database server using:
    
    pg_ctl -D /var/lib/postgres/data -l logfile start

If you are unable to run initdb you may need to do the following (make sure to make the new user a superuser):

```
sudo -u postgres createuser --interactive
```

Now navigate to the backups folder and run the following:

```
createdb -T template0 tldrDb -U (name_of_user_you_just_made)
psql -d tldrDb -U (name_of_user_you_just_made) -f (most_recent_backup_file)
```
Now you should be able to use psql like so:

```
psql -d tldrDb -U (name_of_user_you_just_made)
```

Now exit the `su` from the postgres user like this: 

```
[postgres@Voltron ~]$ exit
logout
```

To take advantage of our scripts in the project directory you'll want to set
your postgresql data directory as a environment variable. This is dependent on 
your operating system and shell. For me, on Arch Linux, using a zsh I simply 
added this

```
export PGDATA="/var/lib/postgres/data"
```

to my .zshenv, for mac and bash you probably want to add that to .bashenv. You 
may be able to get away with adding it to your .bashrc but be careful. If you're
on windows then you can add this by going to Control Panel -> System -> Advanced
Tab -> Click Environment Variables and then add it either to user or globally 
your choice.

In order to set this variable, you'll need to figure out where the data directory
is. This can be done using the db, below is an example on my machine:

    ~ | sudo -u postgres -i
    [postgres@Voltron ~]$ psql
    psql (9.6.5)
    Type "help" for help.
    
    postgres=# show data_directory;
         data_directory     
    ------------------------
     /var/lib/postgres/data
    (1 row)
    
    postgres=# 

# Simple Commands
See ref 3 for a cheatsheet, and the postgresAdminCmds.md file 

## Login
I've created user names for all of you, here is a list of them:

    Role name |                         Attributes                         | Member of 
    -----------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------
     Dan       | Superuser, Create role, Create DB                          | {}
     Jeff      | Superuser, Create role, Create DB                          | {}
     Mihai     | Superuser, Create role, Create DB                          | {}
     Ra        | Superuser, Create role, Create DB                          | {}
     Spencer   | Superuser, Create role, Create DB                          | {}
     postgres  | Superuser, Create role, Create DB, Replication, Bypass RLS | {}


To login you need to run this command:

```
psql -d mydb -U myuser
```

The Db is named `tldrDb` so if I were Rahul I would do this from a shell
```
psql -d tldrDb -U Ra
```

# Other Commands
You can see other commands by typing `help`. Nothing complicated. See the sql 
directory in src/ for some examples. I'll add them as I go.

# Importing and Exporting
See ref 2 for more info. There is a bunch of things we can do here.

## Exporting
We need to synchronize databases for development. Our needs aren't that complex
So I think we can just perform SQL dumps. An SQL dump spits out a bunch of sql
that when loaded into a database will recreate that database.

The dump is output to stdout, so the command is like this:

```
pg_dumpall -l tldrDb -U Jeff > tldrDb_bkup_9272017
```

or in general:

```
pg_dumpall -l dbname -U username > outfilename
```

I've written a script to automate the time date stuff for us. You can find it in
$PROJECTROOT/lib/scripts. Run it __in the script directory__, I know that is 
annoying but until we have django setup we won't have the $PROJECTROOT variable
set. Thus I had to hardcode the outfile path. Here is an example usage

    (tldrResearchPaper) SE/tldrResearchPaper | cd lib/scripts
    (tldrResearchPaper) lib/scripts | ls
    Dbdump.py
    (tldrResearchPaper) lib/scripts | ls ../../bkups
    tldr_bkup_Jeff_28_09_2017_163052
    (tldrResearchPaper) lib/scripts | python Dbdump.py Jeff
    All done!
    (tldrResearchPaper) lib/scripts | ls ../../bkups
    tldr_bkup_Jeff_28_09_2017_163052  tldr_bkup_Jeff_28_09_2017_165721


## Importing
To import we just feed the sql file back into the database
```
psql dbname < infile
```
